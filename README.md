VimDriver - test drive vim from python
==========

This project is basically just a direct port of Vimbot, which you can find [here](https://github.com/maxbrunsfeld/vimbot).  It is only tested on Windows and therefore likely doesn't work on other platforms.

See the [test file](https://github.com/svermeulen/VimDriver/blob/master/tests/TestVimDriver.py) for usage.

Note that it depends on [these files](https://github.com/svermeulen/ave) as well.
